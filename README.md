# Dense-LucasKanade
This script is the dense implementation of the Lucas Kanade Optical flow that is implemented in OpenCV Python sparsely.

This modification tracks every pixel in an image rather than only tracking the [good features](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_shi_tomasi/py_shi_tomasi.html)
